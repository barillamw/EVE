    Manage plant's water and light based on sensor readings and application scheduling

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Practice entrepreneurial thinking by design and build a solution to a problem that people face. Houseplants have become a common item for young adults to own, but these plants come with additional responsibilities and can make traveling difficult. To help maintain these plants, EVE will water and provide light to house plants. With it's accompanying phone app, the system reads in data directly from the plant and takes the necessary action. 

Objectives:
* Create a solution for a problem
* Complete market research for current market competitors
* Design a minimum viable prototype
* Complete full business proposal and pitch for product
* Present designs to board of investors
<br />

## What I Learned
Aside from the business and project management skills that this project taught me, I learned about python backend scripting for mobile applications, embedded system design, and was exposed to Kotlin development. 

This application used Python server requests to remotely control the system from our application. Using multiple on boards wtihin the system I was able to interpret the signal from the app and take actions such as change lighting and release water. The sensors would read data and store it to an AWS cloud to maintain historical data. 

Coming from a primarily low level programming backgorund, my exposure to Kotlin in this project gave me insight into how application files are structured and how to build basic functionality. I am excited to continue to explore this as I move forward with learing about software development.
